    <h1>HIIII BABYYYYYY HAPPY ANNIVERSARY</h1>
    <p>
      You'll eventually be led to a full letter, but this is a brief quick recap:  
      I'm guessing by now you've scanned the QR code on the purple flower — hopefully everything went smoothly.  
      Holyyyy I had to learn so much to set this up but gotdamn am I happy; and I hope you are too. I love you so much.  
      Right now you're very much mad and frustrated at me still about the Ishaan thing, I'm very sad tbh that you aren't texting me,  
      but in the meantime I made this!!!!!
      <br><br>
      Basically, in case you can't tell — I made you a website 💻  
      You can scroll around. It accounts for our 1–12 months together, highlighting moments and stuff around it.
      <br><br>
      Hopefully you liked the sunflowers 🌻 — I know you love those.  
      You're so precious and I freaking love you.  
      <br><br>
      BYEEEEE FOR NOWWWW I LOVE YOU!!!

    <h2>Month 1</h2>
    <p>
      Month one was the best, I just figured out who the most beautiful girl on the planet was (duh you) and I legit turned into the happiest guy on earth;  
      I don't think I've ever shown someone off so much on social media — you were just a blessing to be with.  
      No fights really yet, just happy happy happy. I asked you to be my girlfriend this month and guess whatchu said.... YESSSSSSSSSSSSS.  
      I love you so much.  
      We went out to play soccer, random walks throughout Central Park; you showed me that random diner that you and your dad went to,  
      and we tried out Manhattan's most expensive arcade — which we still have yet to win the prize for.

    <h2>Month 2</h2>
    <p>
    June consisted of me being dragged away into Ocean City and not letting me see my beautiful girlfriend; imagine that — two months in and you're captured away and not able to see your everything. That's baddddd bro.  
    I guess I ate a lot of sushi though because I came back like 30 pounds heavier. Nevertheless, you still loved me so so so much.  
    THIS WAS ALSO WHEN SATS WERE BECOMING IMPORTANT OH LORDDDD. At least we struggled together.  
    <br><br>
    We also went to Mercer Labsssssss — look at us being original, because shortly after everyoneeeeee copied us.  
    Then for a moment there I got nervous. Soccer was starting and we started becoming distant.  
    I was focusing on my parents’ business and you were focusing on soccer practices. Gotta admit I was very scared.  
    <br><br>
    But this was also a very memorable month because it's when I started introducing you to all of my friends.  
    We went out with them a few times — you met Christian, Ishaan, Angel — all of my closer friends,  
    and we went to ball out on the soccer field ayyeeee.  
    <br><br>
    We started to stay up unhealthily — calling late, texting late, everything — just so I could have your presence a little longer.  
    But badabing badaboom I was back in NYC again and there was my beautiful girlfriend standing right in front of me.
    <br><br>
    I also finally got my stupid Humane AI pin that I was so excited about. It's actually sitting right in front of me rn (not working lmaoaoaoa).  
    <br><br>
    BUT THEN I FINALLY SAW YOU AT THE STEP PROGRAM YESSSSS — and this was when my Columbia program was starting too.  
    THERE WE GO. I CAN FINALLY SEE MY GF.

  <h2>Month 3 – Your Birthday 🎉</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>JULYYYYY DO YOU KNOW WHAT JULY IS? IT’S THE BIRTH MONTH OF MY BABYYYY.</strong>  
    Happy Early Birthday again my beautiful. You’re really my shooting star and firework everyday.  
    God, you don’t know how happy I was to see you that day — I wanted to surprise you so bad and hopefully I did.  
    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <strong>BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS “ehh”... but I saw my girlfriend — and that’s what always matters.</strong>  
    Then off to Ocean City I went again. Until I was back again — YAY!!!
    <br><br>
    Man, did it really suck seeing Christian and Jennah going out everyday while we were so separated.  
    But I really trusted in our relationship. I felt like I was growing up.  
    You started teaching me something this month — I still haven’t fully grasped it, but...  
    <strong>It’s that texting so much doesn’t matter — it’s the attention and love behind it.</strong>  
    <br><br>
    **You also saw MESSI this month.** That’s a blessing by itself.
    <br><br>
    What I loved most is that even though we were far away, we compromised.  
    It showed that you really did want me. I loved those face-mails, I loved those facetime calls,  
    and I loved those good morning and goodnight paragraphs.
    <br><br>
    I also picked up your favorite car this month...  
    <strong>THE TESLA CYBERTRUCKKKKKK 🛻💨</strong>
    <br><br>
    And guess what officially started this time?  
    <strong>🎓 My Columbia Program — it was GO TIME.</strong>  
    FIRST thing off the bat — <strong>my job is to see my GF.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <br>
    But then... we got into our <strong>real first big argument 💔</strong>.  
    Right now I don’t remember what it was over, but we were in a Yard House, and you just completely ignored me.  
    Oh wait — I remember now. I started checking your phone because I was insecure.  
    I was so confused how someone so beautiful could love me and not be interested in someone else.  
    But somehow, you were. I’m so lucky.

  <p>
    <br>
    COLUMBIA CLASSES WERE <strong>SOOO FUN 🎓</strong>.  
    ...and then I got an <strong>atrocity of a haircut✂️😅</strong>  
    You saw the Cybertruck in person for the first time, we hung out in Union Square (and... we also did *that*... in the Cybertruck 😏)  
    <br><br>
    <strong>And we went to THE EDGE! I'm all the wayyy up!</strong>  
    I really am. I’m the luckiest ever to be dating you.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then... I was off.  
    To Rhode Island to visit the big Harvard in Boston.

  <h2>Month 4 – August Honeymoon 💛</h2>
  <p>
    August was my favorite month by far. It started off rocky — the first day was National Girlfriend’s Day,  
    and I (unfortunately) had no idea it even existed 😅. My beautiful girlfriend was furious — and rightfully so.  
    But I tried to make it up to her with Vietnamese food at Saigon Shack and some sunflowers 🌻 (hope it worked just a little).

  <p>
    What really made this month magical was the feeling — it truly felt like the honeymoon stage.  
    We went to Central Park and rowed one of those boats together 🚣‍♀️ for just $4 — and honestly, we NEED to do that again this year.

  <p>
    Then... disaster 😭. My baby got snatched away — all the way to Buenos Aires, Argentina ✈️.  
    I missed you *so much* during that time. We kept up through FaceTime, left little facemails for each other,  
    and it reminded me just how much I yearned for your presence every second cheering me on; and I hope I was there for you every time as well :)

  <p>
    We explored Chinatown 🏮, caught a movie 🎥, and just fell deeper in love every second.  
    No fights. Just laughs. I really couldn’t stop falling in love with you this month.  
    Gina, you're the best thing that’s ever happened to me.

  <h2>Month 5 – September Shift 🎓</h2>
  <p>
    September, the month of schooooooooool.  
    But first — my mom crashed out on me that day. Broken iPad, yelling, stress… but you had my back.  
    I'm not gonna lie, it was embarrassing crying to my girlfriend, but you made me feel safe.  
    <strong>I love you so much for that, beautiful.</strong>
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    This was when I started to feel like more than just a boyfriend. I started to mature.  
    I was becoming your *partner*. You gave me that shirt from your dad’s old company — the one with the camera —  
    and I wore that thing like it was my armor.   
  </p>

  <p>
    You opened up to me more this month. Told me things about your past. Trusted me.  
    That meant so much — and it made me fall for you even harder.  
    <br><br>
    And THEN... I realized the YouTube channel I’d been watching — **Design Syndrome** —  
    was literally my future brother-in-law. That was insane I swear you gotta be my soulmate or some💀
  </p>

  <p>
    School officially started, and I was back in hell. But it felt different this time, Idk what it was but having you by my side this time with school starting felt very easy, very calming, need i say... very demure? *bro you used to spam that word to me every day*  
    I was in class with Cynthia, and you’d pop in and out — and it made everything better.  
    You had more patience with me than I had with myself.

  <p>
    Ishaan tried hosting something — it did *not* go well, but I’m glad we went.  
    I met Zihann (for the first and last time 😭). By the way I know I take some awful photos of you—  
    but they’re my *prized possessions* because you’re in them.

  </div>

  <p>
    I changed this month.  
    I went from a 2.5 GPA to a literal **4.0**. I crushed the SAT. I applied to college.  
    And you? You were there through every stressful second.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thursdays became *our* day — matched our schedules. And we made the most of it.  
    Even looked for Halloween costumes 🎃  
    <br><br>
    I studied like never before. You didn’t just support me — <strong>you made me better.</strong>

  <h2>Month 6 – OCTOBER / SIX MONTHS TOGETHERRRRR 🎃🔥❄️</h2>

  <p>
    October... ooooo Halloween.
  </p>

  <p>
    What kicks off October? **BF DAYYYYYY.**  
    Yoooo, my girlfriend did NOT forget about me at all. She got me some amazing flowers (my dumbass didn’t keep them alive — don’t kill me 😭).  
    (Your blue flowers are still alive and well though!)  
    We did random stuff — went to Central Park and just walked around. It was peaceful.
  </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    I also took my SAT for the last time. After all the prep... I finally got a **1490**. Gotrdamn.  
    This month was so random — I have so many photos of me and my family out in the wild.  
    Like hello??? I was on a horse for some reason?

  <p>
    I ALSO MADE THE GINA FLAGGGGG 🏁.
  </p>

  <p>
    Around this time, I started chilling with Haris (even though you didn’t really know him yet).  
    I found this secret spot in our school church and ate lunch there with him every day.  
    Probably not the holiest use of a sacred space 😅.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also hit up the photo booth in K-Town!!! 📸  
    That day was straight fire

    And then... the escape room 😏.  
    You already know what happened after there — naughty naughty kids.  
    **BUT WE WON THO — LET’S GOOOOO.**

  <p>
    Everything was going so well. Our 6-month anniversary was coming up.  
    A Halloween party was around the corner. School was going amazing.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Then... fire. A literal fucking fire.  
    Like... where does a fire even come from??

  <p>
    I swear my whole life shifted.  
    I lowkey believe in religion, and I feel like it was karma or something.  
    We kept going to that spot in the church and messing around.  
    Ishaan was even smoking in there... it just wasn’t good.  
    I feel like I sinned **hellaaaaa** bad. And then boom — fire.

  <p>
    My family and I moved into a hotel for a few days.  
    Then a few days turned into a while.  
    Because you know what was next? **Bryant Park Winter Village**, Sea Park, Lazy Dog —  
    this was about to be **OUR year.**
  </p>

  <p>
    Basically, we were living in Manhattan now. Look at us — cool as hell.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then... **6 MONTHS TOGETHER.**  
    Six. Freaking. Months. I was so happy.
  </p>

  <p>
    We went to Spygames and I gave you that long ass letter.  
    (You still have it, right???)

  </div>

  <p>
    Honestly... it felt so relaxing to live in the city.  
    I finally understood why you love it so much.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our 6-month was one of the **longest days we ever spent together** —  
    and it was a weekend, so we went all out.

  </div>

  <p>
    But then I had to drop my baby off for STEP again this fall (I didn’t even get in, rip 🥲).
  </p>

  <p>
    We took some digicam photos that I still have stuck behind my phone case —  
    so I can always carry a little glimpse of you with me wherever I go.

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Tbh, I don’t know what was up with me this month —  
    I think my hormones were going wild cause **all I wanted to do was get freaky** 😭.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was such a sucker for Columbia University.  
    I wanted to get in so bad it became my whole personality.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then my dumbass got another haircut 💇‍♂️.
  </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    And then... something really special came along.
  </p>

  <p>
    You wanted to go ice skating at Bryant Park for the first time.  
    <br><br>
    Not knowing just how much **I would fall in love with it.**
  </p>

  <p>
    We went on a little double date with Christian and Jennah,  
    and holy gotdammit I was **so bad** at skating 😭.

    And officially — **Bryant Park Winter Village** had begun.  
    <br><br>
    This was a turning point in my life.  
    And it set everything in motion.

    THEY’RE ACTUALLY SO SLOW 😭 We’re 100% the better couple.  
    (Did you know they’re basically back together again?!)
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m ngl, you were a <strong>BADDIE</strong> in that costume.  
    I wanted to smash <strong>so bad</strong> (bro's cooked, he's full of lust in his mind rn).
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>SIDE NOTE IN HERE:</em><br>

    November was lowkey a bummer ngl.

  <p>
    Trump also somehow won something that month?? I don’t even know.  
    Maybe it was the air or something... something was up with November bruh.

    Y’know what was kinda cool though?

    We even organized a little group hangout where everybody came to Bryant Park and we went ice skatingggg.  
    That was such a vibe.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I’m not gonna lie — I was getting home at like 12am every night.  
    I hated that. I felt... disconnected.

  <p>
    November was honestly kinda ass looking back at it.  
    Whoever has a birthday in November... sorry bro 💀
  </p>

  <p>
    We also saw that <strong>HORRENDOUS</strong> play that Jamil was in —  
    I’m not even putting the photo in. It was <em>so</em> ass. LMAOAOAO.
  </p>

  <p>
    I stayed out a LOT that month.  
    Then Seapark was set up at Union Square. Then Columbus Circle. Then Herald Square.  
    Boom boom boom. Money money moneyyy.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Sorry, just ran into this photo while writing —</em>  
    <strong>IMMA BITE YOU.</strong>

  </div>

  <p>
    I think I was expecting November to be a lot more exciting.  
    I was working at one of the busiest spots in the world... but it just wasn’t fun.  
    Gotdamn. It wasn’t it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t know what it was, but that month took a hard toll on me mentally.  
    I didn’t find time for school. I didn’t find time for our relationship.  
    It was just SeaPark, SeaPark, SeaPark. Grinding and ice skating on repeat.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then... I broke my girlfriend’s heart.  
    I got into the worst argument we’ve ever had.  
    <strong>She blocked me.</strong> Holy fuck. That day hurt so much.  
    I’m not gonna lie — I’m getting a little sad just remembering it.  
    <strong>From the bottom of my heart... I’m so sorry, love.</strong>  
    I never want to hurt you like that again.

  </div>

  <p>
    I genuinely thought it was over. I thought I killed our relationship.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I guess with time... it healed.  
    I realized I needed to take control of my life — figure out who I am, where I stand, how I can be better.  
    It sounds cliché and corny, but holy...
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>WRESTLING TIMEEEEEEE 🤼</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I was actually mad excited. But with everything else going on... it pushed me over the edge.  
    I know it sounds weak or dumb, but I was falling apart.  
    The fact that a 95 on an assignment was tearing me apart says a lot.
  </p>

  <p>
    I needed my girl. I needed my cutie pie.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>GOTDAMN am I happy I didn’t do wrestling.</strong>  
    That was the best decision of my life.
  </p>

  <p>
    I guess we recovered eventually.  
    I see more smiles from you in the photos again.  
    I still don’t know why that month felt so stressful... but it did.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Nothing cheers me up more than your smile, baby.</strong>

  <p>
    I think genuinely, you were my lifesaver there.  
    I was in such a low moment again.  
    But seeing you smile, seeing you laugh, feeling your warmth?  
    It lifted me up. You made me feel like I could grow again.  
    From that small baby... into a big man 😊  
    I love you, darling. I’m so grateful to have you.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>WE WENT TO FEROXXXXX 💪 (and I beat your ass, hehehe)</strong>  
    Come beat me up.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also hired Bri, Ishaan, Davis, Lala, Christian, and Irene LMAOAOAOAOA.  
    It was turning into a whole operation at this point.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then... Thanksgiving 🦃

  <p>
    I know this message is a little late, but I just want you to know:  
    <strong>I'm thankful for you.</strong>  
    Thank you for saving my life.  
    Thank you for making me a better person.  
    Thank you for bringing my smile back with your beautiful smile.  
  </p>

  <p>
    We’ve had our ups and downs, and November was definitely a down...  
    But gotdamn, you made my life light up again.  
    I love you so, so much.

  <h2>Month 8 – December ❄️🎂</h2>

  <p>
    I’m ngl — December started off really unhealthy.  
    I was pulling all-nighters 4–5 days in a row while my parents slept,  
    playing Fortnite ‘til 5am, my skin was breaking out...  
    It was not a good look 💀.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>BUT!</strong> We took our December SAT together —  
    and that was SOOOOO cool 🤓📚  
    Then we had breakfast with your mommaaaa — that was really cute hehe.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    QUICK JUMP TO DECEMBER 13 — ‘cause I wanna be the main character for a sec 😌  
    That day was genuinely so much fun.  
    Even though Christian was 2 hours late (again), I finally got to see everyone.  
    <strong>AND I WALKED JUG ON MY BIRTHDAY — YIPPEE 🎉</strong>
  </p>
  <div class="carousel-container">

  </div>

  <p>
    Then... I got rejected from Columbia.  
    Wow. Happy birthday to me 🙃  
    Then came Fordham. Another rejection. LMAOO  
    BUT WOOOO — <strong>Scranton came through!!!</strong> Random school, sure...  
    But $160k scholarship is crazy!
  </p>

  <p>
    So there went my birthday 🥲
  </p>

  <p>
    Then my cousin got married to some random dude I never met,  
    and that wedding was lowkey funny 😭
  </p>

  <p>
    On December 16th... my dad’s jewelry shop caught fire.  
    It didn’t burn to the ground, but that day was still stressful as hell.  
    I swear this month was testing my family in every direction.

  <p>
    Davis and I were ice skating a LOT.  
    You and I were ice skating even more 🧊  
    Every day felt like “ice skate, ice skate, ice skate” — and I LOVED IT.

  <p>
    We also went to TJ Maxx to get gifts for your classmates  
    and ngl — it made me feel like a grown up.  
    <strong>I wanna grow older with you ❤️</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    And that’s when I found out you were... <strong>allergic to the cold?</strong>  
    Weirdo 😭❄️

  <p>
    But for real, December was pretty jolly 🎄  
    I saw you almost every day. It snowed. The Christmas vibes hit different.
  </p>

  <p>
    We went ice skating at Chelsea Piers! We were out here living it up.

  <p>
    Lowkey this was the <em>chill</em> month.  
    (See what I did there... chill... snow... no? ok.)
  </p>

  <p>
    We visited Rockefeller Center like tourists and I actually really liked it 🏙️

  <p>
    <strong>AND I GOT CHRISTMAS PRESENTS!!!</strong>  
    (I didn’t even know I was supposed to get those tbh — that’s why mine were late btw 😅)  
    You even saw me on Christmas... and honestly, everything felt perfect.

  <p>
    Until it wasn’t.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>9:35am — December 27th</strong>  
    My whole fucking booth lit on fire.  
    Are you deadass??? What is it with me and fires??
  </p>

  <p>
    That day crushed my parents.  
    I’ve never seen my mom back down like that. That business was her life.  
    We watched SeaPark rise from nothing... and burn to nothing again.  
    <strong>That day broke me.</strong>

  </div>

  <p>
    But you came.  
    You KNEW I needed you.  
    And you came and stood by me — stinky breath and all.  
    I wanted to kiss you so bad even without brushing 💀
  </p>

  <p>
    I had never felt so much love until that day.  
    <strong>You stood by me the whole way.</strong>  
    You were there — and everyone else too — but you? You mattered most.
  </p>

  <p>
    So it passed. But damn... that one scarred me.
  </p>

  <p>
    ANYWAYS — PRESENTSSSS 🎁  
    AYYYYY I’M SO HAPPY I GOT YOU SO MANY PRESENTS HEHEHEHE

  <p>
    And that’s it — <strong>2024 finally ended.</strong>  
    And man... I was so happy it did.  
    Because those fires? They really scarred me.

  <p>
    January — you introduced me to <strong>Rubik’s Cubes</strong>!!!  
    Bro I can’t believe I actually figured out how to solve them 😭  
    And ever since... I’ve been addicted.  
    (<em>Imma do you next hehehehe</em> 🧩😉)
  </p>

  <p>
    We wanted to try new ice skating spots, so we went to <strong>Brooklyn</strong> this time.

    Not gonna lie... January was kinda boring   
    <strong>TikTok got banned</strong> (and then came back like 48 hours later),  
    
  </p>

  <p>
    But hey — we went to the <strong>Xavier vs. Regis game</strong> and I was HYPED we won.  
    That was a really fun day 🙌
  </p>

  <p>
    Honestly, there’s not a lot to show for January —

  <h2>Month 12 – April 🌸💜</h2>

  <p>
    April… we made it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I <strong>led my first Kairos</strong> — 
    I came back all enlightened and happy.
  </p>

  <p>
    We finally hung out with Haris properly for the first time too 🙌  
    I was starting to feel like I was finding my people, slowly but surely.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also did the <strong>Ice Bucket Challenge</strong> 
  </p>

  <p>
    You gave me flowers — <strong>11 months together</strong>.  
    That hit my heart in the softest way because I rarely get flowers. I loved that baby I appreciate it; And I promise I'm keeping these safe this time
  </p>

  <p>
    And then we played basketball together 🏀  
    (And lowkey... we ******* you know 😅  )
    Like... a lot. These past two months??  
    <strong>We gotta chilllll 😭😭😭</strong>)
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>(I’m addicted to you.)</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>AND HOLY — BADDIE ALERT 📸👇</strong>

  <p>
    Your brother visited NYC this month too —  
    and you went on so many runs I swear you were training for the Olympics 😭🏃‍♀️
  </p>

  <p>
    And me? I visited <strong>Purdue for the first time.</strong>  
    Everything started to feel... real.
  </p>

  <p>
    And that leads us into this strange, beautiful, emotional thing we call…  
    <strong>May.</strong>  
    Month 1 all over again.

      12 months. One year? A whole year already. I loved making this website, I loved looking through all the photos of us, all the memories. Gina, you're a real blessing to be with. IDC how much time I take up or how much effort I put in; you've made my life truly amazing. You brought my smile back, and now it's time to bring yours back. I've fell so deeply in love with you, simple words cannot describe it anymore; You are geniuely everything I've ever wanted. Thank you for always sticking by my side my love. The point of all of this? i want to show you just how much things happen in a year, and how many more years I want to fold in front of us; hopefully in the future, I'm able to look around and show a recap of my life with my wife, you, to everyone in front of me. You've been such an amazing partner this last year and I cannot be more grateful geniuely. You've taught me lessons that I never thought I would agree to, you've made me more eye opening to other peoples opinions, you've allowed me to shut up and listened, and you've made me so happy. I love you forever Gina. You truly are the most special capybara in my life.
